        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Development of V4 started in December last year, and it's been about 3 months since then.</p>
<p>I apologize for the slow development speed. However, the release of V4 is gradually becoming a reality.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features-planned-for-v4">Features Planned for V4<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features Planned for V4" title="Direct link to Features Planned for V4" href="https://pdfme.com/blog/developing-pdfme-v4#features-planned-for-v4">â€‹</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Add DynamicTable Schema #332</strong></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/3d22843b2486-20240302.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>The table is being implemented differently than planned.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Two months ago, I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementation Ideas for Dynamic Tables in pdfme</a>, but the actual implementation deviated from the ideas at that time.</li>
<li>The implementation is based on <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-autotable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jspdf-autotable</a></strong>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>It was thought that organized classes, options, and layout calculations could be reused.</li>
<li>The code from <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-autotable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jspdf-autotable</a></strong> was ported, unnecessary code was removed, and it's being used for table calculation processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In both the generator and UI packages, the <code>getDynamicTemplate</code> function is called to calculate the height of the table, readjust the Y-coordinate of schemas located below the table, and handle page breaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several critical bugs that have not been successfully fixed for a week.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The implementation of <code>getDynamicTemplate</code> is failing to calculate correctly, which is critical and blocking the release.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form &amp; Generator] The page break does not account for pages beyond the second page. #429</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form &amp; Generator] When spanning across pages, it overlaps due to a padding issue. #428</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bugs are already documented in issues: <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atable</a></li>
<li>Honestly, I'm stuck on fixing these bugs. I don't want to be stuck here, so I plan to start working on the other features introduced next.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Add a Left Sidebar for Placing Schemas #400</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Adding a UI that allows dragging schemas from the sidebar.</li>
<li>The definition of plugins is changing (adding icons), so I intend to include this in this major version.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I don't have a concrete image of how to realize this yet.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Perhaps a template engine like <strong><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handlebars</a></strong> could operate at render time?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, there is a clear need from users. This might also involve breaking changes, so it might be included in V4 depending on circumstances.<!-- -->

<li>I want to release as soon as possible, but I can't determine a release date yet since I don't know when the bugs will be fixed, and I haven't started on the other features.</li>
<li>Currently, only the implementation of the table is completed, and there are still critical bugs to be resolved before release, so it looks like it will take some more time.</li>
<li>If you don't particularly plan to use the features announced in V4, please continue to use V3 with confidence. Necessary fixes for V3, including bug support, will continue.</li>

<p>How to install V4</p>
<p>Versions tagged with next on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator?activeTab=versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm's version page</a> are V4 versions. Currently, version 4.0.0-alpha.0 is released for each package.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/65a828e2f2b7-20240302.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>The following command can be used for installation:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>npm i @pdfme/common@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/schemas@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/generator@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/ui@4.0.0-alpha.0</code></li>

<p>When using V4, modifications will be necessary for past templates and plugins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Templates:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>template.sampledata</code> has been deprecated, and now designer display data is held in each schema's <code>content</code> property.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Modification example: <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/427/files#diff-4f370f85245caa3e9aa10fa5ecded75ba9fca1530600f8ceadc8b94f01f7df77" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/427/files#diff-4f370f85245caa3e9aa10fa5ecded75ba9fca1530600f8ceadc8b94f01f7df77</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugins:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plugins now use <code>defaultSchema.content</code> instead of <code>defaultValue</code> as initial data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/2cb01519cb4a-20240302.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When onChange occurs within a plugin, instead of rewriting the user input with <code>onChange</code>, it is now possible to also change the schema definition itself in the format <code>{[key:string]:string}</code>. If you want to reflect the user input as before, please write <code>onChange({ key: 'content', value: data });</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Versioning Templates:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Templates created with the V4 designer will now have versions. Currently, as it is in development, the property <code>pdfmeVersion:"4-dev"</code> will be added.</p>

<p>I can move to the next step if the table bug is resolved, but honestly, I'm stuck and would really appreciate help...</p>
<ul>
<li>If anyone is willing to help with the following issue, please let me know. I intend to add the information I know to the issue so that we can fix it efficiently when a collaborator appears.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form &amp; Generator] The page break does not account for pages beyond the second page. #429</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm stuck but want to move forward, so I intend to start implementing the following feature in March.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Add a Left Sidebar for Placing Schemas #400</strong></a></li>

<p>I couldn't make good progress in February, but the contributors did an excellent job. Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fix pdf text render overlap by avoiding line breaks in pdflib #417</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It's not merged yet, but this PR that added color type is cool too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Added support for color type option in generator #436</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are infinite ways to contribute to OSS beyond code.</p>
<p>First, use the software, and if you think it's good, introduce this library to your friends. If you find a bug, please register it from <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p>It might take some time, but I try to reply as much as possible and look through the comments.</p>
<p>V4 will include the table feature I had given up on when I started creating this library, and this was something I could never have done alone. I am grateful to supporters, contributors, and users. I am amazed by the power of OSS, and now I feel like we can create the best PDF library!</p>
<p>I will update you if there are any more updates. Thanks for reading to the end.</p>]]></content>

<p>Until now, pdfme has been realizing simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_data_printing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">variable data printing</a> by embedding PDF data into a property called <code>basePdf</code> in the template and overlaying a <code>schema</code> on top of this PDF.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/b7b9c0b7611e-20240102.png" alt="Image of the pdfme process" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This method is incredibly simple and allows for the easy creation of customized PDFs.</p>
<p>However, there is a significant need that cannot be ignored for certain use cases in PDF creation.<br>
<!-- -->That need is table rendering. More specifically, many users want to address cases where the number of rows, like in the red-framed section of the image below, increases, such as in invoices.</p>

<p>The method of overlaying a schema on the basePdf, as explained above, doesn't allow for an efficient implementation of page breaks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current version of pdfme cannot support tables where rows dynamically increase.</p>
<p>I understand this need but was struggling with how exactly to implement it.<br>
<!-- -->This has been the main blocker in implementing Tables.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-implement-page-breaks">How to Implement Page Breaks<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Implement Page Breaks" title="Direct link to How to Implement Page Breaks" href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#how-to-implement-page-breaks">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>I've been <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/discussions/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing</a> this with users for quite some time, and finally, there seems to be a way to implement page breaks. Two key elements have come together:</p>
<ul>
<li>ReadOnly Schemas added in <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/releases/tag/3.2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V3.2.0</a>
<ul>
<li>Line, Rectangle, Ellipse, SVG, Text, Image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new way to specify basePdf and padding implemented for <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V4</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/blob/c4dfa7023a42d9ab207784a6557f902c078bdcd6/packages/common/src/schema.ts#L87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlankPDF</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With ReadOnly Schemas, it's possible to design the static parts of a template within pdfme without loading a PDF designed in basePdf. This allows for the addition of the height of schemas added to the page, adjusting the y-coordinate of all schemas below it by the increased height. Padding also allows control over where to resume rendering after a page break.</p>
<p>The following figure shows an example where 19 rows of table data are provided, causing a page break, and the 'note' schema being pushed down.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Example of table with page break" src="https://pdfme.com/assets/images/dynamictable-eb7022dddcbdde6eb391b60f751ae4a1.png" width="4705" height="3766" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The logic I had in mind was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render the table one row at a time, from Header to Row19.</li>
<li>As the height increases and spills over the first page at Row 12, a page break occurs, creating a second page.</li>
<li>After rendering up to Row19, the generator function returns the final height of the table, which is retained in a variable like yAdjust (190mm in the figure above).</li>
<li>For all schemas below the increased height schema (in this example, 'note'), add the increased height (190mm) to their y-coordinate. The rendering starts on the second page at a y-coordinate of 140mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is that it doesn't accommodate fixed layouts like headers or footers. In that case, instead of specifying the size of <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/blob/c4dfa7023a42d9ab207784a6557f902c078bdcd6/packages/common/src/schema.ts#L87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlankPDF</a>'s width and height, specify a PDF containing the fixed design of the header or footer. This is planned for further modification.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-tackle-the-complexity-of-table-settings-and-rendering">How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering" title="Direct link to How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering" href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#how-to-tackle-the-complexity-of-table-settings-and-rendering">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Table settings and rendering can get complex. How should we approach it?<br>
<!-- -->I want to leverage the simplicity of pdfme, which allows for easy PDF creation, to implement the table functionality.</p>
<p>For example, consider how to set up the following table.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/5607ddfc06c7-20240102.png" alt="Example of a complex table" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A table is essentially composed of headers (th) and table data (td).<br>
<!-- -->Table data may be rendered in something other than text. In this example, <code>Name</code> and <code>Category</code> columns are rendered with a Text renderer, while <code>Image</code> column is rendered with an Image renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, pdfme already implements various renderers like Text, Image, SVG, Barcodes, etc. Therefore, there's no need to create new rendering processes for each cell; once the size and position of a cell are determined, existing PDF rendering processes can be used.</strong></p>
<p>This leverages the plugin architecture of pdfme's rendering processes, potentially simplifying complex tasks.</p>
<p>This idea came from an <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/332#issuecomment-1872032370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting comment</a> left by <a href="https://github.com/MP70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP70</a> on the dynamic table issue.<br>
<!-- -->Considering the above, I believe the table should do the following three things:</p>

<p>The following image shows a QR code setting panel, but similar style settings should be possible for tables as well.</p>

<p>Add columns to the header and set how they will be rendered.</p>

<p>Once the style and column rendering settings are determined, calculate the layout and render the cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculating and rendering cell positions<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Generally, render at the same x-coordinate as each column, but use the y-coordinate and height of the row above for the y-coordinate. Once the position is set, render the cell using the column settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculating the height of Rows and Cells<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>As explained in the page break section, the increased height needs to be communicated to the generator function.</li>
<li>As a current issue, the Text renderer, if not using the Dynamic Font Size feature, might render beyond the set height, as shown in the image below.

<li>Ideally, the row height should be expanded, as shown in the image below. To achieve this, the Text renderer needs to return the rendered height after rendering.<!-- -->
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/3b7065ee2f39-20240102.png" width="500px">
</li>
<li>The height of each cell's rendering result determines the height of each Row, and the total height of all Rows determines the height of the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>An open-source, free PDF creation library written in TypeScript. It allows for declarative PDF creation using templates and works both on servers and browsers.</p>
<p>Since its beta release in February 2022, it has reached Version 3 by November 2023. On <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, it has garnered 1500 stars, and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>, it sees about 10,000 downloads weekly, though there's some variation.</p>
<p>It's already integrated into various services worldwide, including electronic medical record creation, factory procedure manual production, and e-commerce custom packaging.</p>
<p>This article aims to explain the motivation behind developing pdfme.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-develop-a-pdf-library">Why Develop a <strong>PDF Library</strong>?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library" title="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library" href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#why-develop-a-pdf-library">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Since 2014, <a href="https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdfkit</a>, a fantastic library for creating and editing PDF files, has been available. Another library, <a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf-lib</a>, written in TypeScript and offering additional functionalities over pdfkit's PDF creation capabilities, emerged in 2018.</p>
<p>Both are open-source, free, and available under the MIT License.
So, why develop pdfme despite these excellent libraries?</p>
<p>It started as a simple function with no significant motivation, but it evolved into a passion to "<strong>eliminate the tedious task of PDF creation from the world!</strong>" This drive emerged through the following three steps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-created-a-function-to-return-pdfs-from-json-input-2020">1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~" title="Direct link to 1.

<ul>
<li>pdfkit and pdf-lib are great but require imperative coding and struggle with scaling template numbers.</li>
<li>For a personal development project, I created a function to return PDFs from JSON input, which led to the precursor of pdfme, <a href="https://github.com/hand-dot/labelmake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake</a>.</li>
<li>It seemed convenient, so I published it on npm.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Existing solutions were either too complicated for our needs or required expensive licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an easy-to-use WYSIWYG, similar to PowerPoint, and rebranded labelmake to pdfme, releasing it as a beta version.</p>

<p>Focusing on simplicity while providing sufficiently necessary features.
In Version 3, we released plugins and custom themes/labels, emphasizing "customizability."</p>
<p>Being Japanese, I ensured our product could easily handle <a href="https://pdfme.com/docs/custom-fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom CJK fonts</a>, unlike others focused only on Latin characters. Interestingly, China is where we get the most website traffic.</p>
<p>However, we're not yet sufficiently equipped for common use cases like dynamically changing table heights. We plan to support relative coordinate layouts and dynamic tables in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pdfme/projects/8/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Version 4</a>.</p>

<p>Our current motivation is to contribute to the community at the next level, as pdfkit and pdf-lib have done.</p>
<p>I mainly develop the software, but thankfully, 2-3 people contribute daily.</p>
<p>Bug reports and feature proposals can be made through <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues</a>, and we also have an open <a href="https://discord.gg/xWPTJbmgNV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> channel. Any clear questions in these open forums usually receive a response within a day or two, including from me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="free-to-use">Free to Use<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Free to Use" title="Direct link to Free to Use" href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#free-to-use">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there's no direct monetization from the library.
It can be installed via npm install and used for commercial purposes without worry.</p>
<p>However, development takes time, so I need to earn a living. I'm working full-time and plan to continue this as a side project for the next few years.</p>
<p>Additionally, I operate a service in Japan using pdfme, <a href="https://labelmake.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake.jp</a>, and occasionally monetize through technical support inquiries.</p>
<p>Support (including documentation) is where I believe users have the most need, so I plan to</p>
<p>establish a more reliable system in the future if necessary.</p>
